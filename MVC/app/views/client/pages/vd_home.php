    <p>A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that you can keep in place and you can scroll down
        the page to see different parts of the image. With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can give a parallax
        effect to a website. Using the parallax effect in web designing is really popular and it gives beautiful
        look and feels to the webpage. Give it a try and divide the whole page into three to four different
        sections. </p>

        <p class='col-7 col-s6 intro-2__text '>
            Set 3-4 background images, align the text for different sections, set margin and
            padding, add background-position and other CSS elements and properties to create a parallax effect.
